# DisReserv (v1.0): 3D DISPLACEMENT AND STRESS FIELDS OF COMPACTING RESERVOIR: ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS

Simulate reservoir compaction due to pore-pressure changes by integrating the
solution proposed by Sharma (1956) and Tempone et al. (2010) on the volume of
rectangular cells.
This strategy is similar to that proposed by Muñoz and Roehl (2017).
The difference here is that we solve the volume integrals according to
Nagy et al. (2000), Nagy et al. (2002) and Fukushima (2020)

## Abstract

We have presented alternative solutions for the displacement and stress fields outside and inside of a 3D right rectangular prism  under constant pressure. These solutions are obtained by integrating the well-known nucleus-of-strain solution over the volume of the prism. They are based on the similarity between the gravitational potential yielded by a volume source under a density variation and the thermoelastic displacement potential yielded by a volume source in a half-space under a pressure variation. This similarity enables the use of closed expressions of the gravitational potential 
and its derivatives. We use our solution for approximating the displacement and stress fields
due to a reservoir with arbitrary shape and under arbitrary pressure changes.
We discretized the reservoir as a grid of 3D right rectangular prisms  juxtaposed in the horizontal and vertical directions. Each prism has homogeneous pressure; however, pressure variations among different prisms are allowed.  This parametrization of the reservoir yields a piecewise-constant distribution of pressure in the subsurface.  We validate the resultant displacement and stress fields due to the reservoir by numerical simulations including a reservoir with arbitrary geometry and under arbitrary pressure distribution, based on a production oil field in offshore Brazil.


## Reproducing the results

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/DisReserv.git


All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder. The sources for the manuscript text are in `manuscript` folder.
The figures shown in the paper were generated by running the source codes in the  `code` folder and they were saved in the  `Fig` folder.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
You can view a static (non-executable) version of the notebooks in the
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) webservice:

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinga-lab/DisReserv

See sections below for instructions on executing the code.


### Setting up your environment

You'll need a working Python **3.7.6** environment with all the standard
scientific packages installed (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc).  The easiest
(and recommended) way to get this is to download and install the
[Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).
Make sure you get the **Python 3.7.6** version.

Use `conda` package manager (included in Anaconda) to create a
[virtual environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) with
all the required packages installed.
Run the following command in this folder (where `environment.yml`
is located):

    conda env create

To activate the conda environment, run

    source activate disreserv

or, if you're on Windows,

    activate disreserv

This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.
After running the code, deactivate the environment with the following
commands:

    source deactivate

or, if you're on Windows,

    deactivate


**Windows users:** We recommend having a bash shell and the `make` installed
to run the code, produce the results and check the code. You may download the
[*Git for Windows*](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and the
[*Software Carpentry Windows Installer*](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases).


### Running the code

To execute the code in the Jupyter notebooks, you must first start the
notebook server by going into the repository folder and running:

    jupyter notebook

Make sure you have the `conda` environment enabled first.

This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
interface. In the page, go into the `code` folder and select the
notebook that you wish to view/run.

The notebook is divided into cells (some have text while other have code).
Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
Executing text cells does nothing while executing code cells runs the code
and produces it's output.
To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order or use "Cell -> Run All"
from the menu bar.
